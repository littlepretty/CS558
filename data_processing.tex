\section{Data Processing}
Among various available datasets~\cite{NSL-KDD, KDDCup, DARPA},
we choose NSL-KDD dataset~\cite{NSL-KDD} to evaluate the performance of applying
various deep neural networks to the network intrusion detection problem.
NSL-KDD dataset originates from the KDDCup 99 dataset~\cite{KDDCup},
which was used for the third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tool Competition.
However, NSL-KDD dataset addresses two issues of the KDDCup 99 dataset.
First, it eliminates the redundant records existing in KDDCup 99, which takes up
78\% and 75\% of the records in train and test set, respectively.
Second, it adds another label, classification difficulty, to each distinct record,
and samples the dataset such that the fraction of the record
from a difficulty level is inversely proportional to its difficulty.
Both enhancements make NSL-KDD dataset more suitable for
evaluation of intrusion detection systems.
