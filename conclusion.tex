\section{Conclusion}
In this project we conducted a comparative study on the deep learning approaches
for the network intrusion detection problem.
We take the off-line network intrusion detection dataset NSL-KDD for evaluation.
In this paper, multi-layer perceptron, restricted boltzmann machine, sparse autoencoder
and denoising autoencoder are briefly described.
The main contribution lies on the comparable evaluation of these introduced approaches.
From our experiment results, we conclude that for the NSL-KDD test dataset,
multi-layer perceptron has comparably best performance since both its accuracy and F1-Score
are outstanding.
